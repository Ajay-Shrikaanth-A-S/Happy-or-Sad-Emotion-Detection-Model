# Happy or Sad Emotion Detection Model 

This project implements a CNN to classify images as either "Happy" or "Sad" based on facial expressions. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images, and uses a simple CNN architecture with three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and a fully connected layer. The dataset is preprocessed using the ImageDataGenerator to normalize the images and perform data augmentation. After training, the model predicts the sentiment of new images by classifying them as either "Happy" or "Sad". The project leverages TensorFlow and Keras for model building, OpenCV for image processing, and Matplotlib for displaying images. The model is validated using a separate validation dataset, and real-time predictions can be made on images placed in the testing directory. This project demonstrates the power of deep learning for facial expression classification.
